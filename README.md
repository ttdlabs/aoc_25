# 🎄 Brad's Advent of Code 2025 🎄
### *Where Code Quality Goes to Die (In a Festive Way)*

---

## 🎅 What is this monstrosity?

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2025 solutions, written in Rust! This is where I prove that just because a language has powerful pattern matching doesn't mean I'll use it. Why write a clean `match` statement when you can have a beautiful **if-else chain stretching to the horizon** like Rudolph's flight path?

## 🔔 Features

- ✨ **25 Days of Increasingly Desperate Code** - Watch the quality deteriorate as December progresses!
- 🎁 **Inconsistent Error Handling** - Some functions return `Result<>`, some don't. It's like a lucky dip!
- ⛄ **Hardcoded Default to Day 8** - Because who doesn't want their default to be a random day in the middle?
- 🌟 **Timing Every Solution** - So you can watch me optimize microseconds while ignoring architectural disasters
- 🎄 **That One `if-else` Chain** - 130+ lines of pure branching beauty in `main.rs`. It's GROWING. Send help.
- 🕯️ **Zero Dependencies** - Because I'm too stubborn to use libraries (check that `Cargo.toml`!)

## 🎅 Code Quality Highlights

### Exhibit A: The Main Function
> "Why use pattern matching when you can write the same code 9 times?" - Me, apparently

The if-else chain has evolved. It's now 136 lines. It's self-aware. It dreams of being a match statement.

### Exhibit B: Day 5's Mystery Tuple
```rust
println!("Part 2 Answer: {}", day5part1.1);
```
Part 2 answer from the part 1 variable. Chef's kiss. 👌

### Exhibit C: Day 8's Redemption Arc
Day 8 used to have commented-out Part 2. Now it's COMPLETE with both parts working in "record time" (according to the commit message). Character development!

### Exhibit D: Day 9's Commented-Out Part 2
```rust
//now = Instant::now();
//let day9part2 = day9::part2("09b.txt")?;
//let day9part2time = now.elapsed();
```
The torch has been passed. The tradition lives on.

## 🌟 Lessons Learned

1. ✅ Rust's compiler is incredibly forgiving of my poor life choices
2. ✅ `if-else` chains are a valid design pattern (citation needed)
3. ✅ Timing code makes it look like I care about performance
4. ✅ "Record time" is subjective when you're the only one keeping records
5. ✅ Commenting out Part 2 is now a cherished family tradition
6. ❌ None of the above

## 🎁 Contributing

Feel free to open a PR to:
- Replace the if-else chain with actual pattern matching (it's getting worse)
- Fix whatever fresh hell I've created (now with 33% more hell!)
- Add those dependencies I'm clearly missing
- Explain to me what day 5 is doing
- Uncomment Day 9 Part 2 (when I finally solve it)

But honestly, this is my beautiful disaster. Make your own!

## ⛄ License

This code is free for anyone to use, learn from, or point and laugh at. If it helps you solve AoC puzzles, great! If it serves as a cautionary tale, even better!

## 🎄 Acknowledgments

- **Eric Wastl** - for creating Advent of Code and indirectly causing this
- **The Rust Compiler** - for stopping me from making this even worse
- **Day 8** - for finally being complete. You did it, buddy. Proud of you.
- **Future Me** - I'm so sorry (but hey, we're at day 9 now!)
- **Stack Overflow** - you know what you did
