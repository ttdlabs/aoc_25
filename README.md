# 🎄 Brad's Advent of Code 2025 🎄
### *Where Code Quality Goes to Die (In a Festive Way)*

---

## 🎅 What is this monstrosity?

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2025 solutions, written in Rust! This is where I prove that just because a language has powerful pattern matching doesn't mean I'll use it. Why write a clean `match` statement when you can have a beautiful **if-else chain stretching to the horizon** like Rudolph's flight path?

## 🔔 Features

- ✨ **25 Days of Increasingly Desperate Code** - Watch the quality deteriorate as December progresses!
- 🎁 **Inconsistent Error Handling** - Some functions return `Result<>`, some don't. It's like a lucky dip!
- ⛄ **Hardcoded Default to Day 8** - Because who doesn't want their default to be a random day in the middle?
- 🌟 **Timing Every Solution** - So you can watch me optimize microseconds while ignoring architectural disasters
- 🎄 **That One `if-else` Chain** - 100+ lines of pure branching beauty in `main.rs`. Functional programming? Never heard of her.
- 🕯️ **Zero Dependencies** - Because I'm too stubborn to use libraries (check that `Cargo.toml`!)

## 🎄 Project Structure

```

## 🎅 Code Quality Highlights

### Exhibit A: The Main Function
> "Why use pattern matching when you can write the same code 8 times?" - Me, apparently

### Exhibit B: Day 5's Mystery Tuple
```rust
println!("Part 2 Answer: {}", day5part1.1);
```
Part 2 answer from the part 1 variable. Chef's kiss. 👌

### Exhibit C: Day 8's Commented-Out Part 2
```rust
//now = Instant::now();
//let day8part2 = day8::part2("08b.txt")?;
```
I see you, commented-out code. I see you.

## 🌟 Lessons Learned

1. ✅ Rust's compiler is incredibly forgiving of my poor life choices
2. ✅ `if-else` chains are a valid design pattern (citation needed)
3. ✅ Timing code makes it look like I care about performance
4. ✅ Future me will definitely understand why I did this
5. ❌ None of the above

## 🎁 Contributing

Feel free to open a PR to:
- Replace the if-else chain with actual pattern matching
- Fix whatever fresh hell I've created
- Add those dependencies I'm clearly missing
- Explain to me what day 5 is doing

But honestly, this is my beautiful disaster. Make your own!

## ⛄ License

This code is free for anyone to use, learn from, or point and laugh at. If it helps you solve AoC puzzles, great! If it serves as a cautionary tale, even better!
